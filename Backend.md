#  Backend Development

Backend development for file comparison applications is responsible for handling file uploads and storage, implementing comparison logic, enabling real-time diffs, providing diff merging functionality, and generating diff reports.

### **File Handling**
This section describes how to implement file handling for a file comparison application.
* **Route for file uploads:** Create an endpoint to handle file uploads. Use a library like multer to manage multipart/form-data.
* **Validate uploaded files:** Validate uploaded files to ensure that they are of the correct type and size.
* **Save uploaded files:** Save uploaded files to a designated directory on the server.
### **Comparison Logic**
This section describes how to implement comparison logic for a file comparison application.
* **Text comparison:** Create functions to compare plain text files. Use algorithms like LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) or similar techniques.
* **Image comparison:** Utilize the pixelmatch library to perform image comparisons. Develop logic to calculate perceptual differences between images.
* **PDF comparison:** Utilize a PDF processing library like pdf-parse or similar to extract text content for comparison.
* **Spreadsheet comparison:** Implement logic to compare spreadsheet files. Consider using libraries like xlsx or similar for parsing and comparing spreadsheet data.
* **Folder comparison:** Use the dir-compare library to compare directories. Develop logic to identify differences in file names, sizes, and contents.
### **Real-time Diffs**
This section describes how to enable real-time diffs for a file comparison application.
* **Monaco Editor or CodeMirror integration:** Integrate the selected editor into your application to enable real-time text comparison.
* **Set up event listeners:** Set up event listeners to track changes and dynamically compute differences.
### **Diff Merging**
This section describes how to implement diff merging functionality for a file comparison application.
* **UI for diff merging:** Create a user interface that allows users to interact with the compared files and perform merge operations.
* **Backend logic for merge operations:** Implement backend logic to handle merge requests from the UI. This may involve manipulating file content and updating the diff report.
### **Syntax Highlighting**
This section describes how to implement syntax highlighting for a file comparison application.
* **Monaco Editor or CodeMirror integration:** Configure the editor to provide syntax highlighting based on the selected programming language.
### **Character Diff**
This section describes how to implement character-level comparison for a file comparison application.
* **Diff Match Patch integration:** Utilize the library to perform character-level comparison between texts.
### **PDF Exports**
This section describes how to generate PDF diff reports.
* **jsPDF integration:** Integrate jsPDF to generate and save diff reports as PDF files.
### **File Imports**
This section describes how to parse and extract content from various file formats for comparison.
* **Papa Parse integration:** Implement logic to parse and extract content from various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) for comparison.
